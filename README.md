#Video Comment App Using Ajax
   In this assignment you are supposed to create a comment application that uses Ajax. You will start with a application, which currently allows the user to view a video, and to add comments to it. However, the current implementation is flawed, because when a comment is added, the entire page is reloaded, and the video starts from the beginning. In your implementation, you will fix this.
